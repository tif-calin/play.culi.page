## Wishlist
A list of tools/toys I wanna play with.
 - comments
   - [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es/): based on GitHub issues and looks great and minimalistic. A million times better than Disqus.
   - [giscus](https://giscus.app/): I think `utterances` came before GitHub Discussions API, but that one makes more sense for a GitHub-based comment system. And that's exactly what `giscus` is.
   - [isso](https://posativ.org/isso/): also a well-known open sourced alternative to Disqus. Not sure if it's as flexible as I'd like
 - [variable fonts](https://codepen.io/robdimarzo/pen/eYVpRXm) 
 - design trends and styles. _Frontend developers need to stay trendy. We have to show we're capable of pulling off difficult design systems while also proving we won't be a threat to the design team because of our complete lack of personal taste/originality_ (jk)
   - neumorphism, glassmorphism
   - claymorphism
   - brutalist
   - neubrutalist
 - cool design manifestos:
