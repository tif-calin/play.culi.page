## Wishlist
A list of tools/toys I wanna play with.
- comments
  - [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es/): based on GitHub issues and looks great and minimalistic. A million times better than Disqus.
  - [giscus](https://giscus.app/): I think `utterances` came before GitHub Discussions API, but that one makes more sense for a GitHub-based comment system. And that's exactly what `giscus` is.
  - [isso](https://posativ.org/isso/): also a well-known open sourced alternative to Disqus. Not sure if it's as flexible as I'd like
- [variable fonts](https://codepen.io/robdimarzo/pen/eYVpRXm)
- design trends and styles. _Frontend developers need to stay trendy. We have to show we're capable of pulling off difficult design systems while also proving we won't be a threat to the design team because of our complete lack of personal taste/originality_ (jk)
  - neumorphism, glassmorphism
  - claymorphism
  - brutalist
  - [x] neubrutalist
- design inspo sites
  - [basedash.com](https://www.basedash.com/) - design is slightly unpolished but at least it doesn't look like another Stripe clone
  - bold 2-ish color palettes:
    - [js.org](https://js.org/) - black and yellow
    - [peoplesummit2022.org](https://peoplessummit2022.org/) - blue and grainy white (with purple and yellow secondary)
    - more bold color palettes: https://ronikaufman.github.io/color_pals/
   - "calm computing" vibe: [raquelbreternitz.com](https://raquelbreternitz.com/), [www.a11ywithlindsey.com](https://www.a11ywithlindsey.com/), [urbit](https://urbit.org/blog/urbit-for-normies), [jacobleech.com](https://jacobleech.com/)

Tools that would require a totally new project template
